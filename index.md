# About Me
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Hi, my name is Anjani Kumar. I am a sophomore in B.Tech, Information Technology at B.I.T. Sindri.
I like technology in general and like to make small utility Android apps for myself.
I am a GNU/Linux and open-source enthusiast. I recently started contributing to [KDEConnect](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect) at [The KDE community](https://kde.org/).
I know _C++_ and _Java_ very well. I have done a lot of mini projects on them. I am doing native Android App development from my high school days. Besides developmemt, I have a keen interest in Data structures and Algorithms and I do problem solving too.

Besides work, I listen to music all the time in a wide range of genres from vintage Rock to modern EDMs and Pop. Pink Floyd and Avicii are my personal favourite artists.
