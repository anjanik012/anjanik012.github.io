# About Me
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Hi, my name is Anjani Kumar. I am a pre-final year in B.Tech, Information Technology at B.I.T. Sindri. Originally I am from Ranchi, India.
I love to get my hands dirty by writing small utility apps for myself.
I am a GNU/Linux and open-source enthusiast. 

I contribute to [KDEConnect](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect) and other projects at [The KDE community](https://kde.org/) in my free time.
I love to do _C++_ and _Java_. I have done a lot of mini projects on them. I am doing native Android App development from my high school days an have started writing software for Linux desktop.

Besides work and studies, I listen to music all the time in a wide range of genres from vintage Rock to modern EDMs and Pop. Pink Floyd and Avicii are my personal favourite artists. Read by [blog](/blog) posts.

Feel free to contact me :)
